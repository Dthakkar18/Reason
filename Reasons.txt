I love the skin behind your ears

I love the way you laugh and how your eyes always look up or to the side

I love the way you absolutly murder your burritos when you eat them

I love how you care about your education and prioratize it
I love how you blow your nose like an elephant

I love how you drool ALL OVER THE PLACE when you sleep
I love the taste of your hair
I love how you hug me when we haven't seen eachother in a long time
I love the way you absolutly DRENCH your meals in sause 
I love how you call every container a "du-bee" when it's actually "du-bo"
I love you can draw ANYTHING it's honestly so cool
I love how you sit on the toilet when pooing 
I love the way you sit like a "S" and then complain that your back hurts
I love how you get excited and have the biggest smile
I love the twins......I had to say it eventually 
I love how you sometimes where your pants backwards
I love how we can just make something the kitchen and talk and eat
